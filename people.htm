He is interested in the development and application of data science in the medical field, especially how computational methods can be applied to observe multiple health factors such as social, genetic, etc. In his free time, he likes swimming, exploring Charlottesville’s music and food scene and being with friends. He is apart of the Club Swim at UVA, PHIDE (Co-ed Pre-Medical Fraternity) and Student Council.
